It is the basis for behavioral norms and mutual accountability.</p>\n<p>These principles originate from members of the DWeb Community \u2014 those involved with and convened by the Internet Archive\u2019s work on the decentralized web. These stand alongside other sets of principles that share or expand upon these values, in recognition that our efforts to build a more just and equitable world are interdependent.</p>\n",
