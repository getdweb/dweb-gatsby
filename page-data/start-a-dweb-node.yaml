    text: "No DWeb node in your area? Maybe you should start one.\n

          Local DWeb groups are run by passionate volunteer leaders whose goals align with our principles. It's a chance to gather like-minded people locally, to explore, collaborate, create opportunities to participate and share knowledge about the Decentralized Web and its principles. Read more about what it takes to run a DWeb Node [here](http://getdweb.net/faq).\n

          Here are some of the conditions you should consider when applying:\n

          - Geographic location - Where are you based and in what area would you like to build a DWeb community? Typically it would be at the city level but it's possible it could cover a larger region.\n
          - Purpose - Nodes are for establishing a local hub for conversations and networking around DWeb projects. They serve to educate, share knowledge, and connect people of diverse backgrounds interested in building a better web. They are not for companies to promote their products. Please consider who else in your area would be involved in this node.\n
