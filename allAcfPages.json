It is a space inclusive of persons of all backgrounds, orientations and identities. Dialogue, mutual respect and sharing are at the foundation of the Decentralized Web community and we expect all participants to follow these values. These guidelines help us establish collective trust and engage in productive deliberation.</p>\n<p>Your safety and comfort are our priority. If you have questions or concerns at any point before, during or after the conference, contact us at ethics@archive.org or during the event contact one of the event hosts.</p>\n<p>These guidelines apply to all spaces, real and virtual, during all DWeb events, as well as during set-up and tear down.</p>\n<h2>Expected Behavior</h2>\n<h3>01. Respect</h3>\n<p>All participants and event staff should strive to treat each other with dignity and respect, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, and religion.</p>\n<p>Respect the privacy–both physical and digital–of others.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you want to take a picture, make sure you have consent from the participants. Wearing a yellow lanyard signifies people who have asked not to be photographed.</li>\n<li>Follow the Chatham House Rule when mentioned:<br />\n“When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.”</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>02. Collaboration</h3>\n<p>Be open to new ideas and learning from others–we are stronger when we share.</p>\n<p>In moments of strong disagreement, we ask participants to &#8220;agree to disagree,&#8221; stay focused on the goals of the session or discussion, and move on to address shared needs and shared opportunities.</p>\n<p>We encourage all present to make it a point where possible to talk to strangers and those you know less well, as they are hopefully friends you have not yet met.</p>\n<h3>03. Inclusion</h3>\n<p>When in doubt, mingle! We all have different perspectives that can help each other in worthwhile and unexpected ways.</p>\n<p>In this spirit, avoid jargon, acronyms and complicated phrasing whenever possible.</p>\n<p>Everyone at Decentralized Web events should feel included and it is to everyone’s advantage to be mindful and productively engaged with people from a variety of cultural contexts, communities and regions.</p>\n<p>Follow the &#8220;Rule of 1&#8221; and the &#8220;Rule of n&#8221;: When you speak, make 1 point and then let others speak, and when in a group of &#8220;n&#8221; people, speak &#8220;1/nth&#8221; of the time.</p>\n<h3>04. Communication</h3>\n<p>When listening to input and comments of others, start by assuming the most benign interpretation and the best intention of the speaker. If a comment is phased in a way that might be misinterpreted, ask for clarification of the statement or intent. If the comment is discomforting (or hostile), please reach out to an event organizer.</p>\n<p>Whether in panels or in informal conversation, be mindful not to interrupt others. Listen actively and others will return in kind.</p>\n<p>Avoid grandstanding whenever possible and allow others to participate. The more concise and relatable your point is, the greater impact it will have on other participants.</p>\n<h2>Unacceptable Behavior</h2>\n<p>We will not tolerate predatory behavior or disregard for other persons, either personally or professionally, from or towards anyone—be it speakers, staff or participants.</p>\n<p>We will not tolerate harassment in any form.</p>\n<p>If you are being harassed, you notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an event organizer or use prudence and attempt to mitigate the action yourself. Do not resort to physical contact except in self defense.</p>\n<p>Those who violate our code of conduct may be warned, sanctioned, or expelled at the discretion of the organizers with no refund.</p>\n<h2>Raising Issues at a DWeb Event</h2>\n<p>If you believe you‘re experiencing practices at the DWeb event that do not meet our Code of Conduct guidelines, or if you feel you are being harassed in any way, please immediately contact the event organizer and our DWeb Code of Conduct Team. Email: ethics@archive.org</p>\n<p>The DWeb organizers reserve the right to refuse admission to anyone violating these policies, and/or take further action including expulsion from the event.</p>\n<p>This document borrows from:<br />\nhttps://2016.decentralizedweb.net/conduct/<br />\nhttps://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"D2wYeF5lxj\"><p><a href=\"https://www.rightscon.org/code-of-conduct/\">Code of Conduct</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Code of Conduct&#8221; &#8212; RightsCon Summit Series\" src=\"https://www.rightscon.org/code-of-conduct/embed/#?secret=D2wYeF5lxj\" data-secret=\"D2wYeF5lxj\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><br />\nhttps://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy<br />\nhttps://facilitation.aspirationtech.org/index.php?title=Participants:Guidelines<br />\nhttps://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Friendly_space_policy</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qSBzWFmbff\"><p><a href=\"https://whatever.scalzi.com/2013/07/02/my-new-convention-harassment-policy/\">My New Convention Harassment Policy</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;My New Convention Harassment Policy&#8221; &#8212; Whatever\" src=\"https://whatever.scalzi.com/2013/07/02/my-new-convention-harassment-policy/embed/#?secret=qSBzWFmbff\" data-secret=\"qSBzWFmbff\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"lZGOOau781\"><p><a href=\"https://www.diglib.org/about/code-of-conduct/\">DLF Code of Conduct</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;DLF Code of Conduct&#8221; &#8212; DLF\" src=\"https://www.diglib.org/about/code-of-conduct/embed/#?secret=lZGOOau781\" data-secret=\"lZGOOau781\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><br />\nhttps://confcodeofconduct.com/<br />\nhttps://www.drupal.org/dcoc</p>\n","title":"DWeb Events Code of Conduct","hero_image_desktop":null,"hero_image_mobile":null},"body_content":{"text":""},"body_wide_image":{"image":null},"body_button":{"button_caption":"","button_link_direction":"","button_link_url":""}}]}},{"id":"4ead213a-43c6-5144-8be0-edf613ecbf3f","wordpress_id":551,"acf":{"page_blocks":[{"block_type":"opening","cta_button":{"button_caption":"","button_link_direction":"","button_link_url":"","text":"","title":""},"feature_block":{"button_caption":"","button_link_direction":"","button_link_url":"","text":"","title":"","image":null},"highlighted_statement_content":{"author":"","background_color":"transparent","quote":"","background_image":null},"opening_section_content":{"text":"<p>We would like DWeb ideas and &#8230; reach everyone &#8230;copy goes here that to be seen and heard we need more people to the comms team&#8230;</p>\n<p>if you think we should be present elsewhere too in order to reach more people, and if you are willing to help, email us &#8230;</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>Help us make the DWeb voice stronger and more consistent in the existing channels&#8230; &gt;&gt; link to volunteering roles.</p>\n","title":"Help DWeb ideas spead","hero_image_desktop":null,"hero_image_mobile":null},"body_content":{"text":""},"body_wide_image":{"image":null},"body_button":{"button_caption":"","button_link_direction":"","button_link_url":""}}]}},{"id":"4c50b3ad-23b9-5571-a029-89dad46c6084","wordpress_id":548,"acf":{"page_blocks":[{"block_type":"opening","cta_button":{"button_caption":"","button_link_direction":"","button_link_url":"","text":"","title":""},"feature_block":{"button_caption":"","button_link_direction":"","button_link_url":"","text":"","title":"","image":null},"highlighted_statement_content":{"author":"","background_color":"transparent","quote":"","background_image":null},"opening_section_content":{"text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is much work to be done to build a decentralized web.

For one participant, computer scientist, Brewster Kahle, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/getdconference-brewsterkahle\">the discussions planted a seed</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2015, Brewster Kahle, the founder of the nonprofit Internet Archive, was asked to present a “</span><a href=\"https://blog.archive.org/2015/02/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">moonshot for the Internet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” to five major US philanthropies. “We need to lock the Web open for good,” Kahle told them. “We need to bake our values into the code: security, privacy, reliability.” He challenged builders to create a new, distributed Web.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon, early Decentralized Web pioneers started to answer that call. In June 2016, the Internet Archive hosted the first </span><a href=\"https://2016.decentralizedweb.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decentralized Web Summit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including a </span><a href=\"https://2016.decentralizedweb.net/builders-day/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Builders Day</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that brought together 80 early leaders and thinkers of decentralized tech. Some 350 participants came to the classic temple that houses the Internet Archive to explore the different “layers of the stack” that would need to be decentralized to fulfill an expansive vision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At that gathering, Juan Benet demonstrated the first fully decentralized web site.  Karissa McKelvey showed the world the first browser-based implementation of the DAT protocol. There was a sense, participants say, of the beginning of something revolutionary and new.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2018, the </span><a href=\"https://decentralizedweb.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decentralized Web Summit—Global Vision/ Working Code</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  attracted more than 1000 participants from around the world. The central premise: that tech alone will not save us&#8211;we will need the laws, business models and values to all align behind decentralization if this new movement is to succeed. In just two years, developers were demonstrating  prototypes and working code.  </span><a href=\"https://decentralizedweb.net/videos/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Panels, lightning talks, global fellows events, governance workshops and art </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inspired by decentralization burst from two dozen spaces in the historic US Mint building in San Francisco. As cryptocurrencies were beginning to fuel these fledgling organizations, how appropriate that this group gathered in a place where the majority of the nation’s gold was once stored.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2019, the Decentralized Web became known as the “DWeb,” and organizers decided to create an altogether new experience, </span><a href=\"https://dwebcamp.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DWeb Camp</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Set on a remote farm off the coast of California, the camp drew 450 builders and dreamers reimagining our relationship to technology and the planet. A co-created event, DWeb Camp inspired organizers from Berlin to Shanghai, Austin to Prague to step forward and  form local “nodes” of those curious about decentralized tech. These groups around the globe continue to meet, write and share knowledge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal, however, remains the same as it was in 2014: to create a better web— the web we want, the web we deserve. A Decentralized Web.</span></p>\n","title":"DWeb story begins...","hero_image_desktop":{"id":"3374659c-2c1a-54f5-9c5a-7fbc9bfc3a44","localFile":{"url":"https://staging.getdweb.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DWeb-about-page-1280xs.png"}},"hero_image_mobile":{"id":"056cd85d-d3b6-51cf-a21c-5041d24cac4e","localFile":{"url":"https://staging.getdweb.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DWeb-about-page-mob.jpg"}}},"body_content":{"text":""},"body_wide_image":{"image":null},"body_button":{"button_caption":"","button_link_direction":"","button_link_url":""}}]}},{"id":"1f839bbb-4772-55be-8fc2-009ae5010004","wordpress_id":3,"acf":{"page_blocks":[{"block_type":"body_content","cta_button":{"button_caption":"","button_link_direction":"","button_link_url":"","text":"","title":""},"feature_block":{"button_caption":"","button_link_direction":"","button_link_url":"","text":"","title":"","image":null},"highlighted_statement_content":{"author":"","background_color":"transparent","quote":"","background_image":null},"opening_section_content":{"text":"","title":"","hero_image_desktop":null,"hero_image_mobile":null},"body_content":{"text":"<p>As a project of the Internet Archive, this website follows its <a href=\"https://archive.org/about/terms.php\">Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and Copyright Policy</a>.</p>\n"},"body_wide_image":{"image":null},"body_button":{"button_caption":"","button_link_direction":"","button_link_url":""}}]}}]
