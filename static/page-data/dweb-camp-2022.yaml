    text: "SAVE THE DATE: August 24-28, 2022 at Camp Navarro, near Philo, California\n\n
          Set in the beautiful redwoods near the Mendocino coast of California, DWeb Camp is a five-day retreat for dreamers and builders. For those who want to create a decentralized web that is more open, private, secure and fun. DWeb Camp is a place where diverse people can freely exchange ideas about the technologies, laws, markets and agreements we need to build a better digital future.\n\n
          NOTE: We are also looking for volunteers. August 22-23 is the CAMP BUILD and August 28-29 is the TAKE DOWN."
