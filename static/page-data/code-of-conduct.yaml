    text: "## Overview\n

          The Decentralized Web network hosts events that bring together a community of professionals from around the world. It is a space inclusive of persons of all backgrounds, orientations and identities. Dialogue, mutual respect and sharing are at the foundation of the Decentralized Web community and we expect all participants to follow these values. These guidelines help us establish collective trust and engage in productive deliberation.\n

          Your safety and comfort are our priority. If you have questions or concerns at any point before, during or after the conference, contact us at ethics@archive.org or during the event contact one of the event hosts.\n

          These guidelines apply to all spaces, real and virtual, during all DWeb events, as well as during set-up and tear down.\n

          ## Expected Behavior\n

          ### 01. Respect\n

          All participants and event staff should strive to treat each other with dignity and respect, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, and religion.\n

          Respect the privacy\u2013both physical and digital\u2013of others.\n

          1. If you want to take a picture, make sure you have consent from the participants. Wearing a yellow lanyard signifies people who have asked not to be photographed.\n
          2. Follow the Chatham House Rule when mentioned:\\\n
          \"When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.\"\n

          ### 02. Collaboration\n

          Be open to new ideas and learning from others\u2013we are stronger when we share.\n

          In moments of strong disagreement, we ask participants to \"agree to disagree,\" stay focused on the goals of the session or discussion, and move on to address shared needs and shared opportunities.\n

          We encourage all present to make it a point where possible to talk to strangers and those you know less well, as they are hopefully friends you have not yet met.\n

          ### 03. Inclusion\n

          When in doubt, mingle! We all have different perspectives that can help each other in worthwhile and unexpected ways.\n

          In this spirit, avoid jargon, acronyms and complicated phrasing whenever possible.\n

          Everyone at Decentralized Web events should feel included and it is to everyone's advantage to be mindful and productively engaged with people from a variety of cultural contexts, communities and regions.\n

          Follow the \"Rule of 1\" and the \"Rule of n\": When you speak, make 1 point and then let others speak, and when in a group of \"n\" people, speak \"1/nth\" of the time.\n

          ### 04. Communication\n

          When listening to input and comments of others, start by assuming the most benign interpretation and the best intention of the speaker. If a comment is phased in a way that might be misinterpreted, ask for clarification of the statement or intent. If the comment is discomforting (or hostile), please reach out to an event organizer.\n

          Whether in panels or in informal conversation, be mindful not to interrupt others. Listen actively and others will return in kind.\n

          Avoid grandstanding whenever possible and allow others to participate. The more concise and relatable your point is, the greater impact it will have on other participants.\n

          ## Unacceptable Behavior\n

          We will not tolerate predatory behavior or disregard for other persons, either personally or professionally, from or towards anyoneâ€”be it speakers, staff or participants.\n

          We will not tolerate harassment in any form.\n

          If you are being harassed, you notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an event organizer or use prudence and attempt to mitigate the action yourself. Do not resort to physical contact except in self defense.\n

          Those who violate our code of conduct may be warned, sanctioned, or expelled at the discretion of the organizers with no refund.\n

          ## Raising Issues at a DWeb Event
